# Spring Security 6 Documentation

In this project, I will be creating a Banking Web App using Java, Spring and Spring Security 6.

I will start by creating a very basic Spring application with the most basic level of security using Spring's Security starter dependency. This uses a pre defined username of 'user' and an auto-generated password which can be found in the console and renews each time the program is run.

I will then move onto implementing more secure levels of security and build gradually.
