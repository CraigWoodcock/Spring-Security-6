# Spring Security 6 Documentation.

In this project, I will be creating a Banking Web App using Java, Spring and Spring Security 6.

I will start by creating a very basic Spring application with the most basic level of security using Spring's Security starter dependency. This uses a pre defined username of 'user' and an auto-generated password which can be found in the console and renews each time the program is run.

I will then move onto implementing more secure levels of security and build gradually.

## Adding Basic Security to Our Application.

To add the most basic layer of security to our application, we need to add a dependency to the pom.xml file. This security dependency will require the user to enter a username and password when trying access our application. The pre-defined username will be 'user' and the password will be generated in the console when the application is run. To enable this level of security, we simply need to add the following lines to our pom.xml file:

```
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
	</dependency>

```
The issue is that the password is reset every time the application is run and there is only 1 user. This may not be practical even for testing purposes as the password that is generated is long and complex and so we may look to use more secure methods even in testing situations.
